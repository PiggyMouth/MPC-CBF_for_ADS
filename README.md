# MPC-CBF_for_ADS

The source codes for the work "Robust Safe Control for Automated Driving Systems With Perception Uncertainties" by Yan Feng Yu are listed here.

## Carla

The simulation is performed using [Carla simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) version 0.9.12.

## Scenarios

To run the simulation codes, please download [Scenario runner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner) provided by Carla.

The autonomous agents are based on KeyingLucyWang's repository [Safe_Reconfiguration_Scenarios](https://github.com/KeyingLucyWang/Safe_Reconfiguration_Scenarios). The least required files are `test_config.txt`, and files in the "navigation folder".
